        Its not everyday that one witnesses a morning like the morning was on the 21st of August 2000, 
        sun was shining brighter than usual, wind rushed faster, trees ruffled within making a chirpy noise,
        clouds being unusually white and pure as if they spread a new set of them on an ocassion like none other, as 
        if nature was ordered from above to prepare a joyous welcome for someone special in their warm arms
        as the clock showed 8:30 in it ... time stopped for a moment as that someone special took her first breathe
        and broke her first cry in this very world who was waiting for her.
        Truely ...a special one ... with godlike eyes who when glanced with would make the flowers bloom and 
        angelic smile that would make the sunset even more beautiful. Cheeks as soft as cotton and cry loud as if she was announcing
        her arrival to the nature who was waiting for her with open arms as she wasnt just someone borned everyday but 
        someone special ...sent from above on whom god spent his most hours creating, born on a Monday ...The day of Shiva 
        and the only god she believes in. With majestic features it was obvious she was a godschild
        As if sun was brighter that day to bless her with shine to light up the lives of people around her 
        As if wind was faster to bless her with the ability to sooth peoples mind heart and bring a smile on their face like breeze does 
        and clouds were the sign of her purity and trees clapped when she arrived 
        Her birth was the amalgamation of god and nature coming together to bless her with divine like feautures and sent here to bless the earth
        and the lives of people she walked into to spread positivity and prosperity.
        Its been 23 years to that beautiful day and that little angel has now grown into a beautiful woman
        I have seen her and she looks exactly how she is described above, lighting lives of people
        She is bold, courageous, beautiful, breathtaking, glowing, chirpy
        She is Power She is Luck She is a Blessing She is everything that a Godschild is 
        She is PRANJAL

            <h4>Your moon sign is Taurus</h4>
            You are a solid, warm and earthy individual and everybody knows that. Family and relationships 
            are of the utmost importance to you and you need a stable and harmonious 
            environment to feel fully grounded and contented. You possess an innate love 
            of the simple life and nature’s peaceful energy is something to which you instinctively respond. 
            However, we also know how you also are very attracted to luxury and quality - you love beautiful objects and receive
            great pleasure from owning them like your DA MILANO and beautiful dresses and sneakers.
            In order to feel secure you need to be financially stable. 
            You will work hard; you persevere through hardship and have the capacity 
            to build up material stability for both yourself and your family
            and we have seen you work hard for that and you will continue to achieve great things in life because they are meant for you
        </div>
        <div class="para2">
            <h4>Your sun sign is leo</h4>
            It is very obvious to guess her sun sign whoever has met her can tell she is a leo without looking at her brithdate
            because how she is so confident in whatever she does ... be it rolling out in style or bullying her loved ones lol,
            She is so comfortable being the center of attention because she has that aura that attracts people and can handle 
            attention at any point of time like a celeb.
            How she adores drama, is ambitious about getting married to a person whod retire her from her job and provide her all his attention and love and care(money too bec she fancy luxury but also can compromise with the right person who truely loves her),
            Shes loyal, fiercely protective of their nearest and dearest tho she bullies her beloved sister but thats another expression of love only haha,
            She the cutest mighty "duck-with-a-knife" leo
